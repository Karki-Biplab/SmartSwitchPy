# SmartSwitchPy ⚡🧠  
**Built by Biplab Karki – Kathmandu-based Software Engineer | IoT + Python Enthusiast**

SmartSwitchPy is my personal side project to control Tuya-compatible smart switches using Python and the `tinytuya` library. This is for devs, tinkerers, and smart home explorers who want full **local** control — no cloud or app dependency.

Whether you’re flipping a switch or crafting full-on automations, this repo gives you a solid, scalable base to build from.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Turn Tuya WiFi smart switches ON/OFF from your terminal  
- 🧠 Object-Oriented codebase — easy to modify or extend  
- ⚙️ Uses `config.json` to store multiple devices  
- 🌐 Fully offline – local network control, no cloud API  
- 🔧 Clean CLI-based interface (for now…)

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.6+  
- 2.4GHz WiFi Tuya-compatible smart switch  
- Device ID, IP address, and Local Key (get it using `tinytuya wizard`)  
- Local WiFi connection (no need for cloud access)

## 🧪 How to Use It

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biplabkarki/SmartSwitchPy.git
cd SmartSwitchPy
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your devices

Copy the sample config:

```bash
cp config.sample.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` like this:

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "Bedroom Plug",
      "id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "ip": "192.168.x.x",
      "key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "version": "3.3"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll be prompted to select a device and toggle power.

## 🌱 Roadmap (Next Plans)

- [ ] Add Flask or FastAPI-powered web dashboard  
- [ ] Scene-based automation (schedules, rules)  
- [ ] Google Assistant / Alexa voice control  
- [ ] Support for sensors (motion, temp, etc.)  
- [ ] Group and control multiple devices at once

---

## 📦 Sample Config (config.sample.json)

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "Living Room Lamp",
      "id": "****-*****-****",
      "ip": "192.168.*.**.***",
      "key": "*****************",
      "version": "3.3"
    }
  ]
}
```
